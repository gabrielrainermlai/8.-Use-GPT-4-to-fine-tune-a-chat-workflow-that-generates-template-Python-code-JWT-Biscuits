Problem Description

I need an expert with OpenAI APIs to build new workflows in GPT-4 that allow OpenAI to generate boilerplate/template python code for an end user based on a chat conversation. The end-user will ask to begin writing queries against a new web3 database, and the chatbot will need to generate python to:

authenticating with the APIs of this new web3 database (which is complex and requires JWTs) see: https://docs.spaceandtime.io/reference/user-id
fine-tune GPT-4 to write template python that imports the JDBC driver for this web3 database
fine-tune GPT-4 to add python code that writes SQL against the database and performs whatever actions the user requests
For example, the end-user could ask the chatbot, "write me a python script that connects to Space and Time and inserts a new table with the following fields..." and then your App will return python code that has template scripts to authenticate with Space and Time, and wraps the drivers into a little python SDK with a function to insert a new table.

Acceptance Criteria

Deliver a simple python app (such as a Flask app) with APIs for a front end web service to deploy a chatbot on a new website, which allows the end-user to ask it to generate specific python. For example, the end-user could ask the chatbot, "write me a python script that connects to Space and Time and runs a query which shows the following fields..."

Technical Details

The app must deliver a GPT-4 workflow to write a python SDK + backend API which handles the following workflow: https://docs.spaceandtime.io/reference/user-identifier-check
